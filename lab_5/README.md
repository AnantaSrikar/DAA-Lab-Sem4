1. `strassens_multi.c`: Program to multiply two square-matrices of order 1024 X 1024 using Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication.

2. `bonus_1.c`: Program to find the i th smallest element that runs in O(n) time.

3. `bonus_2.c`: Program to find the median of 2n elements that runs in O(log n) time

## Execution
1. `strassens_multi.c`: doesn't take any command line inputs. `./a.out` would work.
2. `bonus_1.c`: takes in command line arguments as follows: `./a.out <size of array> <ith element> <array>`.
3. `bonus_2.c`: takes in command line arguments as follows: `./a.out <size of both arrays> <arr1> <arr2>`.
