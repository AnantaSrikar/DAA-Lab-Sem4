1. `knap_sack.c`: Program to find a solution vector (x1 ,x2 ,x3 , ... , xn ) in such a way that we have to get the maximum profit, for a given objects and a knapsack.

2. `jobs_seqn.c`: Program to find a solution vector (x1 ,x2 ,x3 , ... , xn ) in such a way that we have to get the maximum profit for a given set of jobs with deadlines.

## Execution
1. `knap_sack.c`: takes in command line arguments as follows: `./a.out <no. of objects> <weights> <profits> <capacity of knapsack M>`. Eg: `./a.out 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 3`.
2. `jobs_seqn.c`: takes in command line arguments as follows: `./a.out <no. of jobs> <deadlines> <profits>`.
